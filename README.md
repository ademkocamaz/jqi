# jqi
The almighty jq processor, wrapped in a GUI.
---
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/tutorial/) is like sed for JSON data - you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends let you play with text. Visit [jq manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) to learn more about its capabilities.  

**jqi** facilitates the work with jq by wrapping it in a nice graphical user inteface and adds more functionality, which boost your productivity while querying & processing JSON data, for example: importing JSON from clipboard, files or even from network using cURL command, rich display of the imported JSON data with the ability to expand/collapse it, saving jq programs history in memory, exporting jq program output to JSON file and more.

**jqi** is currently available only for Mac OSX, but will be soon available for Linux & Windows as well.

## Tips
- Use keyboard shortcuts to control **JQI**. Hover with your mouse on a button and see it's hotkey.
- Open JSON file right from your teminal:
  `open /Applications/jqi.app --args -f _JSON_FILE_PATH_`
